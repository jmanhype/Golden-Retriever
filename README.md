# Golden-Retriever

Golden-Retriever is a framework for high-fidelity retrieval augmented generation in industrial knowledge bases. It integrates jargon identification, context recognition, and question augmentation to overcome challenges in specialized domains.

## Features

- Jargon and context identification
- Dynamic question augmentation
- Efficient retrieval system integration
- Adaptive answer generation
- Extensible and customizable architecture

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/golden-retriever.git
cd golden-retriever
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
from golden_retriever import GoldenRetrieverRAG

# Initialize the framework
rag = GoldenRetrieverRAG()

# Ask a question
question = "What is the role of wear leveling in SSDs?"
result = rag(question)

print(result.answer)
```

## Configuration

Set your OpenAI API key in a `.env` file:

```
